## Information We Collect

Islam Encyclo is designed to work without user accounts or registration. The app collects only limited information necessary to operate features reliably and improve quality.

### App usage and diagnostics
- Collects anonymized usage information such as screen interactions, feature usage, session duration, app version, and basic device characteristics.
- Data is used in aggregate to understand feature performance, improve stability, and fix errors.
- Crash and error reports may include technical device state at the time of failure but do not identify individual users.

### Device and preference information
- Stores selected language, theme, reading progress, prayer preferences, reminders, and similar settings locally.
- Processes limited non-personal device information (OS version, locale, connectivity status) for proper formatting, downloads, and feature behavior.

### Advertising data
- Displays ads to support continued development.
- Advertising partners may receive standard advertising identifiers and limited device/interaction data.
- Advertising data is managed according to provider privacy policies and system ad personalization controls.

### Push notification data
- Stores device notification tokens and basic metadata to deliver reminders (e.g., prayer times, app updates) if notifications are enabled.
- Notification delivery statistics may be collected to ensure reliability.

### Location and sensor access
- Location access is requested only for features that require it (prayer times, Qibla direction, nearby mosques).
- Motion and orientation sensors may be used temporarily while these features are open.
- Location is not continuously tracked in the background.

### Microphone and media access
- Microphone access is only used for voice-based features initiated by the user.
- Audio is processed on-device and not stored or uploaded.
- Camera or photo library access is requested only when creating or saving images.

### Local storage and offline content
- Quran audio, documents, and other media are stored locally for offline use.
- The app does not retrieve copies of locally stored files.
- Download success/failure may be logged anonymously to monitor reliability.

### Content hosting and delivery
- Quranic audio, graphics, and media are hosted on secure servers and fetched on demand.
- Requests carry no personal identifiers beyond standard connection metadata.

### Over-the-air updates
- Controlled update mechanisms deliver fixes and features without full app store updates.
