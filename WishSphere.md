## Information Collection and Use

WishSphere integrates several third-party libraries and services to enhance functionality. These may involve limited data collection for specific purposes, as described below:

- **AdMob Integration**:  
  WishSphere uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain data such as device identifiers and app usage information to deliver personalized ads and generate performance reports. For more details, refer to Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

- **OneSignal Notifications**:  
  WishSphere utilizes OneSignal to send push notifications. This service collects device information, such as device identifiers and push token IDs, to deliver relevant notifications effectively. Learn more about OneSignal’s practices by visiting their [Privacy Policy](https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy).

- **React Native Async Storage**:  
  WishSphere uses Async Storage for local storage of app data. No personal or sensitive data is transmitted or shared with external servers.

- **React Native Skia**:  
  Enables high-performance graphics rendering for creating and editing cards. This is a local feature that does not involve collecting user data.

- **React Native Permissions**:  
  This library handles permissions for accessing device features, such as storage or notifications. It does not store or share personal data but interacts with your device’s operating system to manage permissions.

## Third-Party Services
