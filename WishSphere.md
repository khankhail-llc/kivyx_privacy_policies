## Information Collection and Use

**WishSphere does not collect or store any personal data from users.** However, the app integrates third-party services that may collect limited information for their respective functionalities. Below are the details of these integrations:

### **Third-Party Libraries and Services**

- **AdMob Integration**:  
  WishSphere uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect non-personal information, such as device identifiers, for delivering personalized ads and generating performance insights. Refer to Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information.

- **OneSignal Notifications**:  
  WishSphere uses OneSignal to send push notifications to users. OneSignal may collect device-specific information, such as push token IDs, to deliver notifications effectively. For more details, visit OneSignal’s [Privacy Policy](https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy).

- **React Native Async Storage**:  
  Async Storage is used to store app-related data locally on your device. This is a local storage mechanism and does not transmit data to any external server.

- **React Native Skia**:  
  Skia is utilized for rendering high-performance graphics within the app. This functionality operates locally and does not involve any data collection or sharing.

- **React Native Permissions**:  
  Permissions are requested to access specific device features (e.g., notifications or storage). These permissions are handled locally by your device’s operating system, and no personal data is collected by WishSphere.

## Data Security

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in third-party integrations or applicable regulations. Any updates will be communicated within the app. Continued use of WishSphere after changes are implemented constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
